The buffer browser plugin provides you an easy way to switch from a buffer to another. The layout has been inspired on the taglist script.

Press the <F4> key to toggle the buffer list on and off. Help can be displayed by pressing the 'h' key. 

General keymaps:

- <S-F3>/<S-F4> to decrease/increase window height by 1
- <C-S-F3>/<C-S-F4> to decrease/increase window height by 5

Usage when not in buffer list:

- <F4> to open/access buffer list panel
- \\0 to \\9 to mark window with number
- \\p to mark window as preview window

Usage when in buffer list:

- h to toggle help
- q to close buffer list (same as CTRL-W q)
- p to preview file in preview window
- d to delete currently selected buffer
- u to update buffer list
- x to toggle path display
- s to toggle sorting by buffer number/name/extension
- n/N to edit file in new window below/above <F4> 
- <CR> to edit file in last window visited before <F4>
- \\0 to \\9 to edit file in window marked 0 to 9
- <F4> to go back to <F4> window
- <S-F3> to decrease buffer list width by 1
- <S-F4> to increase buffer list width by 1
- <C-S-F3> to decrease buffer list width by 5
- <C-S-F4> to increase buffer list width by 5

Remark: the \ is in fact defined as <Leader>, it might thus change regarding your environment settings.

Change log:

- g:BufList_Hide set to 1 or 0 whether the buflist panel shall be respectively hidden or not once buffer is selected (<CR> key).

From 1.5 to 1.6:
